# Before you started working with data you have to learn something about datatypes

# First we learn about Built-in Data Types in Python

# Data type is an important concept in every programming language

# because in programming language because Variables store types, and different data types do different things.

# Python has the following built-in  data types 

# if you want working with then use Numebers DataTypes:	int, float, complex
# if you want working with then use Text DataType:	'str'
# if you want working with then use Boolean DataTypes:	bool
# if you want working with then use Sequences DataTypes:	list, tuple, range
# if you want working with then use Sets DataTypes:	set, frozenset
# if you want working with then use Mapping DataTypes:	dict
# if you want working with then use Binary DataTypes:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

''' How to find variable datatype in python
''' use this method''''
 my_datatype = 89 # or any datatype
print(type(my_datatype))


# Exercise find the Datatype of following code 

Data = "Datatypes"
Data = 20
Data = 23.56
